“Tumblr is the whirlpool for the queer and gender vortex,” explained Kayden, a 21-year-old Filipino American trans college student. Kayden is a participant in my current study on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth’s experiences of identity, politics, and community in contemporary media culture. During our first interview, he enthusiastically talked about Tumblr, a microblogging and social networking site popular among young people—in particular, young queer people. Kayden talked at length about the ways in which the platform allowed him to dive deeply into a space that was, as he said, “all about gender and sexuality. You can lose yourself in there.” Venturing into what he called the “queer vortex” on Tumblr was a central and profoundly meaningful component of his everyday life. As a trans man who had recently begun to transition, Kayden said he needed to feel surrounded and completely immersed in queer discourse, progressive politics, transgender style, gay fandom, and, of course, funny memes. Tumblr provided these for him.
Kayden was not the only participant to discuss Tumblr in these terms. Many of the LGBTQ young people in my study described Tumblr as a queer “bubble,” a “black hole,” a place where you can get “sucked in” and “fall into.” They talked about this dynamic in both positive and negative ways. On the one hand, they extolled Tumblr’s advantages and its queer world-making

potential, but, on the other, they acknowledged its significant risks and shortcomings. In this article, I examine both sides of Tumblr. I argue that the platform simultaneously generates the specter of a “queer utopia” (Muñoz, 2009)—a space where queer potential flourishes, where new more expansive ways to think about the future materialize—and queer “vortex- tuality” (Whannel, 2010)—an experience of being sucked into an online black hole with severe limitations. In contextualizing this argument, I first histor- icize Tumblr as a queer space. I suggest it shares much in common with its historical predecessors—such as the gay bar or the gayborhood—but also brings something new to LGBTQ articulations of self, space, and commu- nication. Then I explore why Tumblr in particular—as opposed to Facebook or Twitter, for example—has become a center of online queerness. Finally, I examine how Tumblr affords users a sense of political agency, possibility, community, and hope (the utopic). At the same time, I interrogate how Tumblr creates a kind of vortex for its users defined by short periods of intense social interactions that do not sustain over time, information bubbles, and dark and potentially harmful niche communities. Crucially, the user experience on the site underscores the profound vulnerability of queer individuals and communities in digital, corporatized space.
This article is informed by approximately one year of fieldwork examining LGBTQ youth, their use of digital media, and experiences of belonging, possibility, and identity. Methodologically, I conducted 27 individual, in- depth interviews, four focus groups, and participant observation on Tumblr and at LGBTQ public events. Interviews allowed me to acquire depth and texture of experience, whereas focus groups stimulated a conversational exchange between young LGBTQ-identifying people. All study participants are between the ages of 18 and 28 and currently live in the American South. Almost all are college students or former college students, since southern universities served as primary—although not the only—sites for participant recruitment. As a result, participants are generally well educated and con- versant in social justice issues. In this article, I draw heavily on their voices and experiences to ground the complex relationship between technology and queerness.
To be clear, I use queer here as an umbrella term to discuss nonnormative forms (identities, spaces, practices, expressions, etc.) of gender and sexuality. Following Halperin (1995), I understand queerness as a “positionality vis-à- vis the normative,” something that exists outside of or in opposition to a heteronormative framework (p. 62). In this way, queer identities include, but are not limited to, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, nonbinary, pansexual, and asexual identities. Although the category queer materializes in the West at the end of the 20th century within the discourses of a more radical sexual politics, in this article I use it to discuss a shared experience of margin- alization along the lines of sexuality and gender across historical time.
 

Historic transformations, queer space, and social media
To understand LGBTQ youth’s engagement with Tumblr, it is necessary to explore the changing character of public space generally, and queer space in particular. While writing queer histories is always fraught, a practice of summoning “queer fictions of the past” (Bravmann, 1997, p. 99) to create a neat and tidy story of the “community,” in this section I construct a brief and partial historical account of queer space.
In the late 19th and early 20th century, LGBTQ people gathered in specific spaces spread across the city that were culturally coded as queer. Certain bars, restaurants, coffee shops, streets, parks, theaters, and bathrooms served as social hubs for queer men and women. For many, these public sites offered the only opportunities for communication, companionship, and sex (Chauncey, 1994). Drag balls and private parties also fostered queer interac- tion. During New York City’s Harlem Renaissance, for example, house parties—also known as “rent parties” where hosts would charge admission to cover their rent for the month—offered relatively safe and discreet spaces for queer people to gather (Garber, 1989). Ghaziani (2014) referred to this historical moment as the “closet era” (p. 13), a time when gay spaces were precarious projects scattered across urban environments.
As many scholars have argued, World War II was the engine that sig- nificantly altered the nature of gay space and community in the United States, helping to consolidate the scattered queer landscape (Bronski, 2011; Chauncey, 1994; D’Emilio, 1983; Faderman, 1991; Kennedy & Davis, 1993). The war effort brought men and women from all over the country together in close homosocial environments, which allowed for sexual experimentation and individuation. After the war, many gays and lesbians settled in coastal cities and built gay enclaves or “gayborhoods,” a new and more consolidated formation of queer space. At this time, the gay and mainstream press framed cities such as San Francisco and New York, for example, as gay meccas,urban spaces that welcomed sexual non-normativity and offered community (Meeker, 2005). This publicity brought queer migrants looking for a better life in urban space. Moreover, the gay liberation movement and the uprising at the Stonewall Inn in New York City in 1969 encouraged public affirmation of one’s queerness and further marked certain urban centers as sites of queer sociality and political mobilization. As Weston (1995) argued, “the gay imaginary is spatialized … the result is a sexual geography in which the city represents a beacon of tolerance and gay community” (p. 262).
Gayborhoods swelled during the “the Great Gay Migration” (Weston, 1995, p. 255) of the 1970s and 1980s as gays and lesbians made their pilgrimage to settle down in gay-friendly urban locales across the United States. Importantly, gayborhoods housed many historic gay institutions such as bars, bookstores, sex shops, social service organizations, political advocacy
 

groups, and social clubs. These locations were also synonymous with sex and safety (Hanhardt, 2013), precious commodities for queer people who were systematically marginalized, criminalized, and targeted by violence. This is not to suggest that gayborhoods were queer utopias. Residents were still at risk for violence, and gayborhoods evidenced their own internal racial, class, and cultural hierarchies.
Yet since the 1990s, gayborhoods have become increasingly gentrified and, as Doan (2015) argued, threatened by “neo-liberal planning interventions to cleanse neighborhoods and make them safe for capital investment” (p. 5). It appears that the gayborhood is weakening as a queer center of gravity. The historic LGBTQ institutions that once thrived there are relocating, unable to afford skyrocketing rents. Residents, too, are priced out of the market and moving out, making way for the young, heterosexual families moving in. These transformations have led queer scholars such as Ghaziani (2014) to question “whether the preservation of a minority group’s way of life—it’s culture essentially—requires a spatial component. Can queer cultures, com- munities, and identities persist in the absence of gayborhoods?” (p. 82, original emphasis).
Apart from the changing landscape of American gayborhoods, other social, cultural, and political shifts are refashioning queer culture, space, and community in fundamental ways. Public opinion has become more favorable with respect to homosexuality (Brown, 2017), and many LGBTQ people are migrating out of the cities and into the suburbs. In some more privileged gay communities, a post-gay sensibility has surfaced, which no longer perceives sexuality as the organizing master identity (Walters, 2014). Sexuality has become simply a marker of one’s sexual preference, not a site around which to politically and socially organize. Participation in historically queer institutions has decreased, and 41% of LGBTQ Americans believe these institutions will become less important as queer individuals are increasingly integrated into society (Brown, 2017). Gay clubs and bars are closing at an alarming rate (Rosser, West, & Weinmeyer, 2008), while those that manage to stay in business are increasingly hailing straight patrons to survive in a competitive marketplace. As with gay bars, media organizations that pre- viously catered exclusively to the gay community have taken to the practice of “dual casting” (Sender, 2007, p. 302), marketing to both gay and straight audiences alike with content meant to appeal across demographics. Furthermore, the rise of the Internet and mobile communications technolo- gies has created new platforms for LGBTQ individuals and communities to meet and communicate. Mobile dating apps such as Grindr, Tinder, and HER allow queer individuals to locate each other for companionship and sex within heterosexual space.
Nevertheless, even as these historic transformations unfold, queer space is not entirely smothered. Visser (2015) argued that rather than discerning
 

these changes through a paradigm of displacement or the destruction of queer space writ large, there is an emergent pattern of replacement, or the development of newer forms of queer space across the globe. Ghaziani (2014) perceived a trend toward the systematic construction of “queer cultural archipelagos” (p. 137), decidedly queer spaces that are smaller and more flexible than, for example, traditional gayborhoods. Whereas queer cultural archipelagos lack the kind of rich history that defines places such as San Francisco’s Castro District, they nevertheless emerge as “hotbeds of queer lives, cultures, and communities, off the beaten path” (p. 141).
In establishing these new cultural archipelagos, LGBTQ people are moving into newer parts of big cities, into smaller cities, and even into the suburbs. Since the 1990s, they have also been establishing hotbeds of queerness in cyberspace. Indeed, queer individuals and communities were some of the first digital pioneers, venturing onto the Web in its early days to find like- minded others (Gross, 2003). The Web seemed like an optimal site for community building given the limited and scattered options available in the physical world. In the past 15 years, social media in particular have afforded fertile ground for queer cultural archipelagos to develop. These sites have become fully woven into the contemporary queer experience, playing a critical role in the everyday lives of LGBTQ people.
Notably, social media perform various sociopolitical and cultural functions for queer individuals and communities. They enable traditional learning (searching for information about LGBTQ issues to educate one’s self), social learning (securing models of collective identity and behavior by observing others online), experiential learning (participating in social encounters and queer enculturation), and teaching (sharing LGBTQ-related information with others; Fox & Ralston, 2016). Social media platforms also now serve many functions of the gay bar, helping individuals “accumulate sexual networks” (Gudelunas, 2012, p. 360) and find partners for friendship, romance, and sex with a sense of safety, control, and ease (Miller, 2015).
Social networking sites have also emerged as vehicles for queer youth to practice intimate storytelling, as they digitally narrate their identities and lives for likeminded audiences (De Ridder & Van Bauwel, 2015). The practice of storytelling is crucial for young LGBTQ people—who often face severe marginalization in everyday life—because it facilitates the individual and collective construction of identity, pride, and, belonging (Alexander & Losh, 2010; Vivienne & Burgess, 2012). Social media also give rise to new queer publics and counterpublics, or those organized collectivities that stand in opposition to dominant society and the status quo (Warner, 2002). Studies focusing on transgender (Cavalcante, 2016) and asexual (Renninger, 2015) counterpublics online show how these spaces create vibrant subcultural exchange and opportunities for affirmative (and anonymous) communica- tion. Online counterpublics offer “experiences of identity, belonging, and
 

ideological affiliation,” but even more “they help to make the management of everyday life possible” for queer people (Cavalcante, 2016, p. 118).
Finally, the queer cultural archipelagos that surface on social media serve as easily accessible repositories for collective memory. Queer people have historically lacked those “institutions for common memory and generational transmission around which straight culture is built” (Warner, 1999, p. 51). In filling this void, social media provide space for memory making, for archiv- ing non-normative sexual knowledge and history. For example, Selvick (2014) found that the Tumblr page “Fuck Yeah Androgyny,” a space for those who do not fit into the male/female binary, actively constructs a much- needed historic archive of androgynous imagery. The archive is significant for the ways it instantiates androgyny in the historical record and commu- nicates its ontological legitimacy to queer youth. But what makes pages such as “Fuck Yeah Androgyny” flourish on Tumblr in particular? In other words, why has Tumblr become a dominant cultural archipelago for queer youth?

The queer world of Tumblr
Across the current social media landscape, Tumblr is widely understood, according to the participants in my study, as the queer standard-bearer. As one participant noted during an interview, “There’s this joke about Tumblr that everyone is queer, or at least some sort of ‘social justice warrior.’ And it’s kind of true.” Current research has confirmed that Tumblr “has been espe- cially revealing of collective online queer trans creativity, particularly around sexual expression, everyday coalitional politics, and genderqueer culture” (Fink & Miller, 2014, p. 613). There are a variety of reasons why Tumblr has become a social and cultural magnet for LGBTQ youth.
There is a touch of queerness to Tumblr’s origin story and the logic behind its architecture. As a teenager, Tumblr’s founder, David Karp, surfed the Web and became increasingly frustrated by the limitations of available blog- ging platforms, finding offerings by Wordpress, LiveJournal, and Blogger clunky, difficult to start, and heavily text-based (Welch, 2011). When he launched Tumblr in 2007, Karp devoted his company to “blogging made easy” (its tagline), wanting to create a space for simple, short, multimedia expression (Cheshire, 2012). In the beginning, the site attracted an eclectic— even queer—mix of users. The first Tumblr blogs focused primarily on media and technology, the arts and creative expression, and pornography and erotica (Alfonso, 2013; Cheshire, 2012).
The site was fundamentally devoted to self-expression and characterized by an ethos of permissiveness. “I’m not into moderating this stuff,” Karp said in 2012, commenting on the site’s wealth of pornographic content. “Tumblr’s an excellent platform for porn, which I don’t personally have any moral opposition to” (Cheshire, 2012). Soon after its arrival, Tumblr gained a
 

reputation for providing digital space to society’s mainstream, its fringe, and everything in between. Importantly, unlike Facebook, Tumblr did not require a real name to sign up. Facebook actively enforces an “authentic” name policy in which users must use their “real” name, one verifiable by official documents. This policy conflicts with the everyday life circumstances of, for example, drag performers and transgender individuals who might adopt multiple and fluid identities.
By contrast, Tumblr opened the door for expressing multiple, queer selves. Users can have more than one page. The site encourages what boyd (2014) called a “crafted identity” (p. 41), one that is characteristically patchwork, dynamic, and evolving. Its design permits users to integrate text, photos, links, and video on their pages, allowing for a multimedia expression of self. Tumblr allows young LGBTQ users to mix and match visual imagery, snippets of popular culture, poetry, and so on to express an emergent identity in a way that sites such as Facebook and Twitter simply do not allow. These characteristics are what drew Priya, a White lesbian in her first year of college, to the platform. She explained, “When I was a junior in high school, I made a Tumblr, and then through Tumblr, I was like, “Oh wow, there’s so many gay people. This is fantastic.” When asked why she thought there were so many gay people on Tumblr, she replied:

They’re everywhere because I think gay itself is alternative, and I feel like Tumblr itself is a very alternative platform, a very alternative social media experience, because there are pictures, you can do quotes, you can do all this stuff, and they’re not really going to censor you. You can do whatever and there’s a lot of openness. I mean they allow porn on there. I don’t know. It’s very queer.

Furthermore, there is a diversity of queer identities represented on Tumblr not seen in other digital spaces, because young people are creating deeply intersectional identities in new ways on the platform. In addition to inter- sections of race and class, Tumblr hosts numerous pages about what it means to be queer and “demisexual” (feeling sexual attraction to someone only if there is a strong emotional connection); queer and “pansexual” (feeling sexual attraction toward individuals along the gender spectrum, including those who are trans, nonbinary, and gender nonconforming); queer and “polyamorous” (desiring multiple sexual relationships at once); and queer and “neurodivergent” (a non-pathological way of describing someone with an atypical neurological condition or disability). Tumblr pages about these identities underscore the intersectional nature of queerness and take care to celebrate and affirm difference.
Another reason that Tumblr has become a queer digital center is its reblog feature. Tumblr is a community where sharing and spreading content that is not your own is expected. This capability is especially useful for young LGBTQ people who may not be out of the closet and who are testing the
 

waters of identity. They may not be comfortable expressing themselves with original content and thus can reblog and share others’ posts. As one parti- cipant explained of her use of Tumblr, “I know I didn’t post a lot of my own things being like, ‘Oh, today was like this and I’m bi.’ I wasn’t super-duper open with it. I just reblogged what other people said about it and was like, ‘Oh, I agree with this,’ reblog.”
Tumblr’s communicative structure also facilitates social exchange in ways that are safer and less risky for LGBTQ users than other Web sites. As mentioned above, users can use nicknames, allowing them to interact with others under a cloak of privacy and anonymity. Using nicknames, Tumblr users can interact online without the threat of being “outed” or the possibility of “outing” themselves. But even more, Tumblr is a safer and less risky space for LGBTQ youth because the site privileges posts, not comments. The comments that users write on posts can be seen and tracked, but they are not automatically visible. To see the comments, one has to actively look for them. This offers another layer of protection to people communicating on the site. Moreover, it disincentivizes users from posting homophobic or transphobic comments. The negative comments would have little impact because most users would not see them. At the same time, Tumblr allows individuals to gradually build social networks of likeminded people. Authors of original posts can be found easily and the site creates a searchable archive of topics through hashtags and search functions. Thus Tumblr’s communi- cative structure allows users to easily find LGBTQ people, progressively build a social network, and search for LGBTQ topics without revealing their “real” identity.
Finally, Tumblr has become a dominant cultural archipelago for queer young people today by virtue of its timing. As the participants in my study were coming of age, so was the digital platform. Both grew up and matured in parallel. Damian, a Latino gay male, perhaps explained it best:
It’s a community of people who grew up together and who did not know what we we’re dealing with. We grew up together with this love of media and nerds. We all found out about Tumblr together and migrated there at the same time. We met and acknowledged each other’s queerness and now we’re growing up together. We flowered our identities together. And we’re still learning together. Little by little, Tumblr expanded and we expanded with it.

Tumblr provided a customizable and accommodating space to queer young people such as Damian at exactly the time they needed it most: as they were testing their identities, hungry for a sense of belonging. Note how many times he used the word “together.” Damian and his cohorts’ experi- ences on the platform not only allowed them to burrow deep into queer content together as a group, but also opened up new worlds. Damian continued, “It started out with finding out you were ‘the gay sibling’ and
 

then there was this ripple effect and now all these other doors are opening and you’re learning about intersectionality and racism and queer people of color and representation and disabled queer people and people who are along the gender spectrum. It’s like a Fibonacci sequence that starts out small and expands exponentially.” Tumblr’s queer world, it turns out, is not necessarily a single-issue information environment, but an intersectional space that rapidly expands queer youth’s social and political imaginary. In this way, I argue that it harbors utopic potential.


Tumblr’s queer utopic
According to the participants in my study, Tumblr is a formation of queer space that brings the utopic into view. According to Sargent (2010), “all utopias ask questions” and are characterized by a kind of “social dreaming,” by a desire for something better, for personal or societal transformation (p. 5). Utopias are motivated by a sort of refusal, “the refusal to accept that living beyond the present is delusional, the refusal to take at face value current judgments of the good, or claims that there is no alternative” (Levitas, 2007, p. 294).
Tumblr generates a specific kind of utopia, one that is both digital and queer. Dickel and Schrape (2017) wrote that digital utopias are unique in that they presume “behavioral changes or a new political order are not sufficient to bring about social change. Instead, new media technologies are viewed as instruments for bringing about the presumed transition” (p. 53). In this way, Tumblr serves as a “catalyst” and a “stepping stone to universal future hopes arising in the course of criticism of current conditions” (p. 53). Tumblr also creates a queer utopia. According to Muñoz (2009), LGBTQ individuals are too often “cast as hopeless in a world without utopia” (p. 98). Their everyday lives are devoid of optimism and lack the specter of something more, something with greater freedom. What is urgently needed, Muñoz (2009) argued, is “a space outside of heteronormativity … [that] permits us to conceptualize new worlds … offers us a critique of the present, of what is, by casting a picture of what can and perhaps will be” (p. 35, original emphasis). Furthermore, Jones (2013) argued that queer utopias may “not necessarily allow for complete emancipation or even happiness, but are suggestive of the potentiality of the future; they give hope” (p. 3). Hope is the fuel that keeps the utopic fire burning.
Tumblr’s queer utopic is energized largely by users’ experiences of margin-
alization in their everyday lives and their hope and desire for something better. Erin, an 18-year-old bisexual woman who attends a southern uni- versity, explained:
You can totally fall into Tumblr. You can just be wrapped up in it for hours and hours just because it’s such a diverse amount of things, and it’s always there on
 

your phone. People I think are just drawn to it because of how accepting it is. It’s like, ‘Just be open with who you are.’ You see all these people being open about their sexuality, which we weren’t as used to growing up in high school. Our high school was oppressively straight. You needed an escape from it. So, I feel like you can totally fall into it and be in the void for however long.
For Erin, Tumblr’s openness, its accommodation of diverse identities and sexualities, and encouragement of self-expression drew her in. Tumblr was a welcome retreat from the stifling, suffocating, and “oppressively straight” high school she attended. Erin’s experience illustrates the ways in which queer utopias furnish “autonomous spaces in which to breathe” (Jones, 2013, p. 3).
Tumblr’s digital, queer utopia also generated political awareness and engagement, along with positive affect for the participants in my study. This was the case for Jesse, a White 22-year-old femme genderfluid person who identifies as pansexual. Jesse is incredibly active on Tumblr and started using the site when she was in high school.
When I was in high school, people started leaving LiveJournal for Tumblr. Tumblr had been created in 2007 and became a huge part of my life. That summer, I went to a precollege program to get college credit for art stuff, because at that time, I thought I was going into art. So, there I met all these people who were cool art student teenagers, who were all talking about Tumblr all the time, and I was like, “Oh, I made the right call. That’s the place to be, obviously, if all these super cool art student people are there.”
As Jesse began using Tumblr more frequently, she soon encountered its queer community. “There were just so many cool, alternative, queer teen- agers on Tumblr that I was meeting. From there, I just started following more and more Tumblrs that dealt with queer issues, political issues.” Jesse credited Tumblr with awakening her political consciousness. For example, after reading LGBTQ-themed blogs and learning what she called “the lan- guage of social justice,” she joined the National Center for Transgender Equality and participated in its online political campaigns. In college, she decided to major in Women, Gender, and Sexuality, volunteered at the Women’s Center, and participated in an LGBTQ speaker’s bureau giving talks across campus about queer identities and issues.
Tumblr also helped sustain Jesse’s activism by providing her with what she called a “happy place” that held the promise of something better. “It’s the way things should be,” Jesse said. “I highly regulate who I am following and who knows what about everything on there because that’s a space that I want to go to have a nice time. I’m so intense about it that I have all these extensions downloaded. I can’t use Tumblr without my extensions because everything has to be exactly the way I set it up. I blacklist tags, I whitelist tags.” Blacklisting a tag blocks any content with that tag from showing up on users’ feeds on their dashboards. Whitelisting a tag ensures that content with
 

that tag shows up on a user’s dashboard feed. As Jesse explained these extensions to the focus group, one participant asked her if in regulating her Tumblr feed so extensively she became out of touch with “the sucky real world.” Without hesitation, Jesse responded, “I don’t need reminders of the world sucking! I am fully, completely aware of that. What I need is a queer space I can go to where it’s good.” For Jesse, this good place provided a model of what could be, inspiring and sustaining her social justice efforts. Indeed, sustaining activists and keeping their hope for a better future alive is one of the critical functions of queer utopias (Steele, 2013).
Within the utopic spaces that Tumblr opened up to participants like Jesse, common sense and taken-for-granted knowledge were reoriented. Queerness moved from the periphery to the center and demanded not only recognition but also comprehension. Participants in Tumblr’s queer utopic are expected to understand—or at least attempt to understand—the various and emerging taxonomies of sexual and gender variance. Hayden, a White trans woman approaching her final year of college, explained: “It’s interesting on Facebook looking at comments and stuff, people talking about transgender people without referencing their human status. Have you noticed that? It’s like, ‘Oh I know a transgender.’ Or like ‘the transgenders.’ We’re just like a word. Some people are like ‘I’m not trans phobic, I know a trans.’ That would not happen on my Tumblr! My human status is just obvious.” She continued, “People on there [on Tumblr] get it. And if they can, everyone else should.” This attitude, one cultivated on Tumblr, has caused Hayden to increasingly talk back to injustices she sees on other social media platforms. “I actually just can’t stay silent anymore when I see that [transgender dehumanization] on my friends’ [Facebook] pages. I know I piss people off, but whatever.”
Similarly, Jordan, a White gender non-conforming gay man who recently
was graduated from college, cherishes what he called Tumblr’s “queer bub- ble.” During our interview, he offered the following in an almost confession- like tone:

I have to say, I downright adore “the queer bubble.” I know it’s probably not popular to say. But I need to have conversations with other people who are on the same wavelength. I need to talk about things in a reasonable way without the freak- outs and stupidity from the last people on earth who should be contributing to the conversation. I honestly don’t have the energy to defend every single obviously common sense thing I say … I also don’t have to explain what being demisexual means, which is a huge relief.

Jordan explained that in his everyday life he typically does not tell others he is gay and demisexual because over and again he has to explain what demisexual means. This repeated exercise in self-definition is frustrating. Yet on Tumblr his demisexual identity is merely common sense.
 

Juniper, a Black pansexual woman in her last year of college, also com- mented that Tumblr facilitates a collaborative construction (and contestation of) queer common sense.
Living in the South, there were a lot of White gay men at my high school. But no queer Black folk. Finding a home on Tumblr made me feel better because I found other queer people of color … There is an open platform for constructive criticism in all areas around intersectionality and race and queerness and it is a safe space to have these conversations. It’s like you can say I see what you’re saying but it’s problematic because of X, Y, and Z. And you can have that not met with hostility. No screaming, no violence, no foolishness. Everyone’s on the same page… It’s not that we all always agree, but we all at least try to learn and do better.
Juniper also discussed how on Tumblr her pansexual and polyamorous identities required little to no explanation. In Tumblr’s queer utopic, these identities are ordinary. As Juniper noted, “Listen, almost everyone on my Tumblr knows about pansexuality. I don’t need to explain it. I also don’t need to defend [accentuates this word loudly] that I am poly either. People just get it.”
Crucially, Juniper brought the expectation that others “get” queer identi- ties with her into the everyday world. In college, she noticed a disconnection between her queer Tumblr community and the LGBTQ student group she attends with respect to knowledge about emerging non-normative sexual and gender identities. As a result, she decided to “do the work. You have to do the work.” For Juniper, “doing the work” meant leading a workshop on emerging queer identities with her LGBTQ student group. “We talked about pansexuality, being poly, being nonbinary, being ace [asexual], and then of course all of the intersections with those identities.” The workshop was a success, and it motivated Juniper, who is also a resident advisor, to give the same talk in her dorm to an audience of both LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ identifying people. Notably, Juniper put what she learned from Tumblr’s queer utopic into practice.
As the stories of the participants in my study reveal, Tumblr can provide a kind of queer utopia that sustains LGBTQ users’ sense of self, encourages them to talk back, and alters what they expect from the people and institu- tions they encounter in everyday life. Tumblr facilitates belonging and motivates users to think differently and more expansively, and to take socio- political action in their local communities. These actions may not necessarily be grand political gestures or the kind of collective mobilizations that start movements. But they affirm and legitimate queer difference, opposing the kinds of assimilationist logics that encourage queerness to hide or blend in. Indeed, the vision of queer utopia that Tumblr offers is, as Muñoz (2009) argued, “an anticipatory illumination of a queer world, a sign of an actually existing queer reality, a kernel of political possibility within a stultifying heterosexual present” (p. 49).
 

Tumbling into the queer vortex
Even as Tumblr harbors affirmative and empowering utopic elements, it also creates a kind of vortex with significant risks and limitations. In his study of the news coverage of the 2005 Michael Jackson court case and its verdict, Whannel (2010) employed the term vortextuality (p. 68) to describe how the story dominated attention across media platforms, resulting in a temporary media frenzy. The court case acted as a massive gravitational center, a vortex, that effectively pulled public attention inward in an almost totalizing fashion. Its coverage drowned out most other news stories. Whannel (2010) described this media process as one defined by “a dynamic spiraling around a powerful center” (p. 68). In historically situating the phenomenon, Whannel (2010) argued that vortextuality is a function of modernity and “has its roots in the acceleration of social processes that begun with industrialization” (p. 67). In particular, two historic transformations have facilitated the vortextual effect: (1) the expansion of the media industries, the multiplication of media outlets, and the proliferation of media content; and (2) the increased quantity and velocity of information available in everyday life. In positioning vortextuality as a modern phenomenon, Whannel is not suggesting that news media have never been preoccupied with certain stories in the past. Certainly they have. Yet in the contemporary, digital, and networked era, the scope, rate, and intensity of the coverage is amplified to such an effect that they create an informational vortex.
Whereas Whannel developed his theory of vortextuality to describe an industrial news practice, I argue that the concept has equal theoretical relevance with respect to media audiences and users. As with the news industries, media users themselves engage in vortextuality, spiraling their focus around a powerful media center. In the context of media audiences, vortextuality is a process of intense user engagement with media for a delimited amount of time. It is the experience of being sucked in, of falling into a mediated black hole. Although media users do not entirely drown out other sources of information, the attention paid to alternative voices in the media landscape is reduced. As with its industrial counterpart, audience vortextuality is a specifically contemporary phenomenon. It is facilitated by the character of digital social media such as Tumblr: their portability, net- worked structure, customizability, and capacity to allow users to be perpe- tually connected to technology and to each other across space and time.
For LGBTQ users in particular, Tumblr generates a queer vortex. Indeed, Tumblr becomes queerer as they use it. Its queerness self-perpetuates in the way its algorithm curates feeds, makes certain posts visible, and recommends blogs to users. As Tomo explained:
When I first started Tumblr, I had almost an equal division between LGBT stuff and just my personal enjoyment of games stuff. The LGBT stuff has now taken over at this point. Every so often I’ll see something about my games stuff but it’s
 

not as much as an equal divide for me anymore. I think that’s over the years because new things keep popping up for LGBT stuff I keep following it and then it just becomes an unequal scale. So, it’s really hard after a while, once you find a space on Tumblr, it’s hard to expand out. Your newsfeed also recommends blogs to you about stuff you’re already interested in. Also, generally your feed is from the people that you follow. So, if you only follow five people, and those people are queer, your newsfeed is always gonna be from those five people and it’s gonna be hella queer.
Whereas this “hella queer” space hints at the utopic, as I have explored above, it also harbors inherent risks, limitations, and liabilities. While it is beyond the scope of this article to examine them all, in what follows I consider four: the temporary nature of social engagement Tumblr affords, the potential information bubble that it creates, the dark underbelly of its communities, and the increasing corporatization of the site.
As the participants in my study routinely expressed, encounters with Tumblr’s queer world were so deeply intense and at times all-consuming that they felt inside a vortex. But as Whannel (2010) maintained, this kind of concentrated attention and constant usage that defines vortextuality can only be short-lived. The vortextual moment is generally unsustainable and will “end as abruptly as [it began]” (Whannel, 2010, p. 67). “The initial physical forces that trigger the effect,” Whannel (2010) argued, “cease to be strong enough to sustain it” (p. 67). Almost all the participants in my study who talked about Tumblr displayed this pattern: a hotly committed period of use followed by a cooling-off stage. Casey, a 20-year-old White, genderqueer lesbian who goes to college in a southern university, signed up on Tumblr when she was a junior in high school. She was drawn to the site because:
You can really purge your mind on there. I was very, very into it when I first started using it because I found all of this queer stuff and I was like, ‘Wow, this is amazing.’ I also went through this really, really tough breakup, and I was on it a lot then as well.” But the time and energy she first invested into the site was untenable. Her use soon became cyclical. “Eventually I dropped off. I didn’t use it that much. But then before college, I started back up on it because it was a good outlet. But once college picked up, I dropped off because classes and school and stuff.
Jess, a White bisexual woman in her third year of college, had a similar experience:
Senior year in high school I made a Tumblr. I was like kind of obsessed with Tumblr. I came a little bit late to it, because like people were talking about it my freshman year and I didn’t get it until senior year, but I was really into it for like all of senior year and then into like freshman year of college. I just found it useful. I don’t really know why I stopped using it so much. I just kind of stopped checking it because it was less applicable to day-to-day life I think. At least at college, you have to have a Facebook to like do anything, so I think I just ended up spending a lot more time there.
 

For both Jess and Casey, their use of Tumblr decreased as the demands of college intensified and as the norms of their social environment changed. The same was true for Lucas, a gay Latino man in his second year of college, but he also believed the site began to offer diminishing returns.
It just like began to lose some of its utility in college, and especially like by the end of my first semester, I really had stopped using it so much, because of time, just I’m busy in college. But also, I felt like I was learning less on Tumblr and more in real life. Like going to the LGBT student club and all these other clubs that I was involved in that focused around social justice. I think it just began to be less relevant. Tumblr also started to feel a bit young. Everyone on there is young and really passionate. I think I might have outgrown it maybe.
Indeed, Tumblr users are young. According to Statista (2016), a market research company, as of 2016, 25.7% of users were between 18 and 24 years old.
Given the intensity they initially invest in the platform, the time the site demands, and the relatively young age of its users, perhaps Tumblr’s queer vortex can only be a fleeting and temporally bounded experience for users. It can never engender a lasting commitment. As Rendueles (2017) argued, the model of subjectivity that abounds online propels us to, “see ourselves as clusters of intermittent but intense choices adrift in the reticular circuitry of postmodern globalization” (p. 157). “We are fragments of personal identity,” he continued, “that collide in digital and analog social networks. The price we pay is the destruction of all projects that require a real commitment” (p. 157). Strong, sustained bonds that endure over time are thus incompatible with the nature of online communities. But there are more limitations that restrict the queerly utopic potential of Tumblr.
One of the clearest risks to life in the digital queer vortex is the limited range of opinion and information present and the potential for one to inhabit an echo chamber of ideological homogeneity. Although media audiences have always engaged in “selective exposure,” or the practice of selecting content that reaffirms rather than challenges their ideological positions (Mutz, 2006; Sears & Freedman, 1967; Slater, 2007), the proliferation of the Internet and digital information technologies affords media users increased control over the kinds of information they see. What does it mean that Tumblr users can simply filter out or click off dissent? The threat of an informational vacuum, or what some call a filter bubble (Pariser, 2011), emerged as a dominant theme in my research on Tumblr. It animated the following conversation that occurred during one of the focus groups I held at a college in the American Southeast.
Tomo: I feel like Tumblr can be a very happy place for people if you make it a happy place. Who you follow and what you see on your dashboard is completely controlled by you as the owner of it. But that has the possibility of making you forget that the world around you actually sucks. Cuz I’m just like “Ah Tumblr.” (He smiles and opens his arms as if to embrace something.) “All the gay people.
 

It’s so happy.” And then I’m like, “Oh, I’m in a world of all cis-heads and they all suck.”
Jamie: Yeah. Because you can regulate what you see, you create this bubble where everyone agrees and everything is great.
Caleb: I’m kinda worried about being opposed to viewpoints that oppose our views. That’s something I have a lot of trouble with because when I hear stuff like that I’m like, “No, why would you close yourself off so much. You should be exposed to these kinds of things.” But then I think in the queer tradition, the name of the game has always been making your own family sort of. And so I don’t see a difference on social media. You can make your own family I guess.

During this exchange, the ability of Tumblr to be a “happy place” by virtue of the amount of control one has over their informational environment is extolled, but soon followed by an air of suspicion. There is the fear of “forget- ting” about the outside world, the risk of creating a misleading agreeable bubble, and the potential for disengaging with alternative viewpoints. These are valid concerns, and they may hold true—at least in part—for some users. However, even as the participants in my study were worried about inha- biting a bubble on Tumblr, they ultimately did not, and could not, reside in one in their everyday lives. Again, they look to Tumblr exactly because they reside in a largely heteronormative and cisnormative world. They are inun- dated with information in both their offline and online experiences that runs counter to their sociopolitical sensibilities and cannot systematically circum- vent information that challenges their attitudes. Recent scholarship on Internet users has echoed participants’ experiences, concluding that, although people prefer attitude-confirming information, they are routinely exposed to content that both affirms and challenges their views in digital environments (Jang, 2014; Kahne, Middaugh, Lee, & Feezell, 2011). Moreover, most parti- cipants were reflexive about their activities on Tumblr, knowing full well they were in an environment of general ideological consensus that did not carry
over outside the platform.
Another risk that Tumblr users take in participating in its queer vortex is the potential for encountering the site’s dark underbelly. As Juniper explained, “There are a lot of nasty, dark sides of Tumblr, as there are with any social media platform. There are some really disgusting parts of Tumblr. I’m talking like racist parts, homophobic parts, parts that outright call for the killing of queer people. There is neo-nazi stuff and methodone fan stuff.” Indeed, Tumblr’s permissiveness works both ways, facilitating queer utopias as well as deeply problematic and vile counterparts.
Those same social and technological attributes that create queer vortex- tuality create other kinds of black holes that are equally seductive and can send individuals tumbling into dark worlds. This was the case for Derek, a Black, gender non-conforming, gay man in his last year of college. Derek remembered:
 

Tumblr was a pretty dark place. It’s a place that has a lot of sides. It’s really easy to get sucked into a lot of different kinds of communities. When I started on Tumblr it started off with just me and my friends from high school and their online friends. It was about music and people were pretty queer. But then when I started self-harming [cutting my arms and legs] it was really easy to get drawn into a community that was focused on that. For about a year I fell far into those communities. It was a crazy experience. A good portion of the people I was Tumblr friends with were either dealing with depression or self-harm and things like that. Every post you see on Tumblr tells you where they re-blogged it from and who the source of the post was. Through looking at who they were blogging from and who started the post it was a pretty easy slope to slide down. But I realized I had to stop using Tumblr all together. It’s a media platform that I can’t really have at this time in my life. Maybe in the future it might be a nice place to do a virtual diary or blog but right now probably not.

In fact, the presence of self-harm visibility on Tumblr has become such a problem that the site has included a warning about it in its “Community Guidelines,” stating, “We aim for Tumblr to be a place that facilitates awareness, support, and recovery, and we will remove only those posts or blogs that cross the line into active promotion or glorification of self-harm” (https://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/community).
Finally, the utopic potential of Tumblr is limited by its position within a corporate structure that prioritizes profitability. Tumblr is not queer-owned and operated. It is untethered from grassroots political activism and has no ties to queer advocacy communities. It is indicative of a historic trend in which LGBTQ communities and identities are increasingly “imbricated in consumer culture” and “are equally functions of a liberal discourse of indi- vidual rights, on the one hand, and a capitalistic economic arrangement, on the other” (Chasin, 2000, p. 23, pp. 2–3). The arrangement that weaves together LGBTQ communities and the market delivers mixed results. Even as Tumblr’s spokespeople promise an inclusive and progressive platform, the LGBTQ community is nevertheless vulnerable to potentially adverse corpo- rate paradigms and policies.
In 2013, Yahoo! purchased Tumblr. During the time of the acquisition, amid backlash from Tumblr users skeptical of the deal, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer famously promised not to “screw it up” (Keitz, 2016). However, soon after, there was a robust push to monetize the company and clean up its reputation. Previously an ad-free environment, Tumblr shortly began to feature advertisements. The platform also began to more aggressively censor its adult and “NSFW” (not suitable for work) content, enraging its users. To the shock of many, that same year, the company censored the terms #gay, #lesbian, and #bisexual on its iOS app. Apple has a strict policy that prohibits adult content on the apps it sells in its online store, and Tumblr complied. Searches for tags such as #gay on Tumblr’s mobile app returned no results. Queer content was essentially rendered invisible. Amid public outcry,
 

Tumblr representatives responded, “The reason you see innocent tags like #gay being blocked on certain platforms is that they are still frequently returning adult content which our entire app was close to being banned for” (https://staff.tumblr.com/post/55906556378/all-weve-heard-from
-a-bunch-of-you-who-are).
In time the problem was fixed, but the same issue would again occur in the summer of 2017 and again coincide with another acquisition. In June of 2017, Verizon purchased Tumblr’s parent company Yahoo! Almost immedi- ately after that, Tumblr introduced a new feature called “safe mode,” which prevented users from seeing adult and NSFW content. Safe mode was made mandatory for all users under 18 years old and became the default setting for new users and for users who are logged out of the site. For users over 18 years old, safe mode can be disabled by making changes in Tumblr’s settings. But as with 2013, safe mode’s algorithm blocked LGBTQ content, branding it as NSFW. Even more, this malfunction happened during Pride Month, which further angered queer users who took to Twitter to express their frustration. “Color me completely unsurprised that Tumblr’s safe mode censors out lgbt content regardless of whether it’s porn or not,” wrote one user (Moreno, 2017). Another proclaimed, “I hate Tumblr now. They’re blocking any lgbtq content for users under 18. What’s the purpose of even doing that?! Let pple express themselves” (Moreno, 2017). Tumblr again issued an apology and has since fixed the problem, but the episode once more underscored the continued vulnerability of LGBTQ users in corpor- atized digital spaces. Indeed, the full effects of Tumblr’s parent company Yahoo! being purchased by Verizon are yet to be determined, and thus Tumblr’s queer potential remains an open question.

Conclusion
As a newer queer cultural archipelago, Tumblr carries the potential to serve as both a utopia and a vortex for young people. I have argued that the online space emerged as a queer center in response to the decline and changing character of historic gay institutions—such as the gayborhood and gay bar— and the migration of queer people online. Young people need a space to interact and a public laboratory to test their identities and become politically motivated. Tumblr offers this space, giving users a glimpse of the queer utopic, the promise of something better, which is largely absent from their everyday lives as well as other digital media platforms.
However, there are serious drawbacks to queer collectivity on Tumblr: the fleeting and noncommittal nature of the interactions afforded, the limits of inhabiting an information environment that mutes dissenting viewpoints, the potential for interfacing with Tumblr’s dark and possibly harmful underbelly, and the vulnerability of queer users on commercialized platforms that prioritize
 

profit over people. Tumblr realistically has no interest in the queer community insofar as it delivers its users as consumers to advertisers. Moreover, as Rendueles (2017) argued, our new digital social matrix has “simply reduced what we expect of social ties” because in online space “a series of discontinuous subjectivities coexist that have no past or future beyond their preferences in the moment” (pp. 72–73). As queer people continue to create communities online, the nature of queer social connection, space and place, and political praxis is changing. At risk is a real and enduring commitment to each other as queer people in the flesh, to historically queer institutions, to common political projects, and to the development of queer public space outside the digital realm.

I first published about Wikipedia in 2002.1  Together with Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and other peer-produced publications like Slashdot, I argued that Wikipedia was a core instance of what was emerging as a new mode of production—commons based peer production. FOSS and Wikipedia represented the potential that “productivity and growth can be sustained in a pattern that differs fundamentally from the industrial information economy of the twentieth century in two crucial characteristics. First, nonmarket production… can play a much more important role than it could in the physical economy. Second, radically decentralized production and distribution, whether market-based or not, can similarly play a much more important role.”2
If the foundation of capitalism is the combination of private property, commodified exchange, and wage labor, Wikipedia (and FOSS, and Slashdot, etc.) were none of the above. The “commons-based” aspect of the practice involved inversion all three core attributes. FOSS and Wikipedia eschewed property-based exclusion as the basic institutional form. The inputs and outputs of production were licensed so that anyone could take them and make what they wanted or needed out of them. An open access commons, whom anyone can use as they need it for either consumption of production, was the basic form. The second critical feature was that production was not for commodity exchange. People were producing for their own and each other’s use and pleasure first, and for sale, if at all, only secondarily. And the third was that most of the production occurred in social contributions and social exchange, rather than as wage labor in markets. At the time, this was true even for FOSS, and it continues to be the case for Wikipedia. We can think of this as the dimension of freedom from markets
—the ability to live our lives under the constraints of social relations other than those dictated by the
need to buy and sell labor to obtain the basic necessities of life.

The “peer-production” part of the practice had to do with the displacement of hierarchy in favor of decentralized coordination, or, as in the case of Wikipedia, self-governance around a set of shared social norms. It was this aspect that at the time I found most distinctive about the then-18-months-old encyclopedia relative to other commons-based practices online: it was fully based on social norms, rather than on technical constraints the prevented “defection” by non-cooperators. It was, “a rich example of a medium sized collection of individuals, who collaborate to produce an information product of mid- to highbrow quality, and is reasonably successful. In particular, it suggests that even in a group of this size, social norms coupled with a simple facility to allow any participant to edit out blatant opinion written in by another in contravention of the social norms keep the group on track.”3 Neither state administration, nor corporate managerial hierarchy was necessary for groups to scale to large numbers and effectively produce critical information, knowledge, and cultural goods. Or so, at
 
least, it seemed at the time. We can think of this as freedom from hierarchy or domination, as distinct from the dimension of freedom from markets.
Along both these dimensions (freedom from markets and freedom from hierarchy), Wikipedia, FOSS, and commons-based peer production (CBPP) were both an idea and a utility.
As an idea, CBPP could serve as a shining light for others, showing a very real possibility of organizing productive life differently. They were instances of a utopian project, like the Israeli Kibbutz movement and the Mondragon federation of worker cooperatives, serving as inspiring examples of the possibility of arranging production outside of market relations. Wikipedia in particular offered an example of how tens of thousands of people could cooperate through debate, persuasion, and shared social norms rather than through either benevolent dictatorship, as many FOSS projects did, through mechanism- design-informed technical affordances, like Slashdot, through voting rules that ultimately subjected the minority to the majority, or through pricing.
As a utility, commons-based peer production could serve as a core set of basic utilities that would give their users practical freedom to work around constraints and sources of exploitation that were built by market-centric, proprietary actors. If Microsoft’s Windows enforced certain constraints on how you could use software or view video, then GNU-Linux would allow you to run the software or use the video as you chose. If Internet Explorer featured weak privacy protection or enforced DRM that constrained fair use of cultural materials, Firefox would provide these affordances. If mobile phone carriers restricted how you could use mobile Internet, spectrum-commons-based community networks would let you connect without being so constrained. If repressive governments tried to spy on you, FOSS could provide incorruptible encryption products that couldn’t be bought or coerced by governments. In each case, beyond the idea of nonmarket, cooperative production, CBPP would produce a set of technical affordances that enabled anyone to circumvent the technologically- embedded control system imposed by market actors or by government authorities.

	Freedom from markets	Freedom from hierarchy
Idea	Emerging at the height of neoliberalism, CBPP offered existence proof that nonmarket, socially-embedded mechanisms could be productive and central to innovation	Allied with the Ostrom school of the commons, CBPP offered existence proof that people could overcome “the logic of collective action”; organization did not necessarily resolve into hierarchy or markets
 
Utility	Affordances developed by nonmarket actors—foundations and networked individuals—create workarounds to circumvent systems designed to extract rents	Affordances produced by anarchic, flat, cooperative networks would provide alternatives to systems that enforced submission to control relationships

Wikipedia’s Great Success: A Nonmarket Basic Knowledge Utility

The most obvious and enduring success of the past twenty years has been the sheer quality, coverage, and usage of Wikipedia. In the first few years, debates over Wikipedia were centered on the impossibility of amateur knowledge providing anything but the most confusing and irrelevant stuff. Instead, Wikipedia has become the basic knowledge utility of contemporary society. It is not the final word on any topic. But, like other encyclopedias before it, Wikipedia has become the first cut on most subjects of significance to any meaningful number of people. Repeatedly over the first few years, reports expressed amazement that rigorous tests of quality found that Wikipedia was, broadly speaking, as good as other encyclopedias or similarly public-oriented sources of information, without being as good as peer reviewed literature available only to specialists in a field. In other words, Wikipedia was at least as good and imperfect as any encyclopedia. Today we see fewer of these studies because the baseline assumptions have changed, and the reasonably high, without being perfect, quality of Wikipedia articles is accepted as a background fact.
This serves a critical role in the category of utility from nonmarket production. When we consider, on the one hand, the extensive surveillance that many commercial companies employ to fund their own offerings as knowledge utilities; and on the other hand, the reams of nonsense that commercial clickbait produces, we see quite clearly the importance of a nonmarket knowledge utility. In political debates, at least in the United States, Wikipedia has come to fulfill a rare role as a source trusted, or at least used and shared, across the partisan divide. In health, a study of the anti-vaccine movement makes quite clear that Wikipedia plays a central role in providing high quality information about the safety of vaccines, while a range of commercial sites purvey clickbait to the contrary.4 Given the high stakes of many of these debates; the incentives and efforts to shape Wikipedia’s articles to represent one viewpoint or another, on politics or on conspiracy theories, Wikipedia’s resilience has been nothing short of remarkable.
So too the continued resistance of the community and the foundation to incorporating advertising, which has allowed Wikipedia to be the only privacy-respecting site among the top online sites.
Particularly as awareness of surveillance capitalism is becoming clearer,5 and the risk that a handful of companies will use massive amounts of data they collect on each of us to shape both commercial demand and political outcomes, Wikipedia has more than justified the idea that having a significant
 
source of knowledge that is free of markets and marches to the beat of drums having nothing to do with dollars is of critical importance.
At the level of nonmarket utility, then, Wikipedia’s success has been largely vindicated. It has succeeded in becoming a critical piece of our knowledge infrastructure. Its resistance to market incentives has played a critical role in its adherence to a reasonable conception of truth as resulting from honest engagement by a community of practice, implemented as a facility that does not seek to manipulate and control its readers.
In retrospect, the miracle of Wikipedia did not consist in its nonhierarchical governance. We have seen a gradual formalization of governance,6 and it has been almost a decade since the first major works that developed the critique of the claim that Wikipedia represented genuinely nonhierarchical production.7 But Wikipedia, unlike FOSS, did retain the fundamental attribute of nonmarket production, consistently refusing to transition to advertising or other commodification of the knowledge the community produces, and insisting instead on retaining the pure nonmarket form.
And yet, there are limits.

The Open Directory Project, which when Wikipedia was born was a coeval effort to produce a search utility that would be open source, nonmarket, and nonhierarchical, has largely dissipated. Open Street Map exists, but has not become to navigation utility what Wikipedia or the major FOSS projects like Apache or Linux have been each in its own domain. Even if one insists that Chrome is FOSS (in the sense that it has the Chromium development community alongside it), Google’s search utility is decidedly commercial and designed to spy on its users and deliver them up to advertisers, and using Chrome with it offers not additional protection. No peer produced commons-based search engine has emerged to any significant degree. The handful of privacy protecting search engines (DuckDuckGo; StartPage) are built by companies, however well-intentioned their founders. Mastadon may have had greater success than Diaspora, but there is no genuinely successful social network whose infrastructure is FOSS and, more importantly, whose governance is in the hands of users. However one might celebrate the ubiquitous adoption of Linux in server farms and embedded devices, it is hard to see how smart devices that run on Linux will, in the normal course of their application in homes, be more open and legible to users, or more resistant to their producers embedding data collection and reporting capabilities that will render the homes in which the devices are deployed susceptible to commercial surveillance.
In the meantime, the success of the open source branch of the FOSS movement, with its focus on innovation rather than freedom, is reflected in the widespread embrace of open source by commercial companies. As a result, most of the major FOSS projects are produced by contributors who contribute
 
as employees of firms that are using FOSS as a strategy to engage in pre-competitive collaboration among firms, as they produce critical inputs to the products they will develop on top of these collaborative innovations. Even FOSS projects that remain governed by a foundation and dependent on volunteer contributions are forced into compromises if they want to retain users. Most prominent here was Firefox’s implementation of DRM in order not to use browser share due to users who wanted to use Netflix and Amazon Prime video. Firms have, as a practical matter, found ways to leverage the products of FOSS as dynamic, innovative inputs into their processes, enjoying the functional benefits of decentralized innovation but circumventing the constraints on exploitation that the social model on which that innovation was grounded originally demanded.
The second way in which the promise of Wikipedia and CBPP fell short of the ideal was in the dimension of freedom from hierarchy. Beginning towards the end of the first decade of Wikipedia’s life, an increasing number of studies began to focus on the limits of its egalitarianism. Gender imbalance, the power of admins, all came under increasing scrutiny. The iron law of oligarchy seemed to reassert itself.8 This didn’t mean that Wikipedia failed as a governance structure. In fact, the community is stable, it has developed quite elaborate procedures for settling disputes and making rules, and as I started out emphasizing, Wikipedia is an unalloyed success as the leading encyclopedia of the day. It has also succeeded in avoiding formal command hierarchies of either the state or corporate form. But it has not developed as a paragon of participatory democratic self-governance.
Nonetheless, I would argue that, like so many of the commons governance models that underlie the literature in the Ostrom school of the commons, successful actual self-governance, however imperfect, still offers critically important lessons in how we might structure large scale cooperation efforts without falling back on formal hierarchy.9 We have a lot more experience with the failure modes associated with doocracy—governance by those who show up and do the work. But we also understand the authenticity of governance be people who volunteer to do work that has important public value, in particular by comparison to governance by people who are out to make a profit.
By the end of the second decade of the twenty-first century, democratic market societies find themselves facing a fundamental crisis of legitimacy. Economic insecurity for both present and future generations has become widespread in the broad middle class that make up the demographic core across these societies.10  Long-term trends of declining trust in government, media, and religion reflect broad and deep loss of faith in authority in a broad range of institutions throughout most of the most economically developed countries.11  The shock of the Great Recession exacerbated these longer term trends, and one can only describe the present state in much of the world’s democratic societies as an epistemic and political crisis. Swaths of the population behave as though they have lost the ability (or will) to distinguish truth from identity-consistent fiction, whether by adopting political conspiracy
 
theories or pursuing flat earth and anti-vaccine conspiracies. Many have turned to new figures of authority peddling atavistic nationalist and racist narratives as an alternative to the hemming and hawing of neoliberalism, with its individualistic dominant frame of the past forty years, rejecting both pluralist cosmopolitan (left-spin) and globalizing market-fundamentalist (right-spin) aspects of Homo Davosis.
What’s Wikipedia got to do with it? Remember Wikipedia the idea, and consider Wikipedia the utility.

Alongside the new ethno-nationalism we see emerging as an alternative to neoliberalism, we also see two other major responses. The closest to “stay the course” we might call techno-liberalism or techno- libertarianism (both versions co-exist in roughly the same class, distinguished by how comfortable they are with redistribution, and settling on universal basic income as the solution that leaves the least disagreement between them). Here, the basic understanding of neoliberalism is maintained, with a particularly strong emphasis on the failures of regulation and government and an effort to focus on private sector solutions to social problems. The main difference is the persistent belief that with just enough data, computation, and connectivity technology can solve scarcity and therefore deliver prosperity for all. A second alternative we might call “nudge progressivism.” Here, the major deviation from the neoliberal settlement is a newfound confidence in the ability or government agencies to collect enough data, and develop sufficiently sophisticated models to overcome the information limitations of regulation, and to then translate this new confidence into “soft nudges” for people to behave in ways beneficial to their own and the public good, while leaving individuals the freedom to opt out of these behaviors. Both techno-liberalism and nudge progressivism combine strong reliance on markets and a reassertion of hierarchy that depends on data to govern benevolently. The main difference is that the techno-liberals imagine the hierarchical power to be located in the hands of private companies—Facebook, Google etc.—while the nudge progressives emphasize data-informed rational regulation by public officials.
Wikipedia’s twin ideal characteristics—as nonmarket and nonhierarchical, a good faith collaboration among people engaged with each other socially—mark it as the ideal anchor for an alternative way out after the collapse of neoliberalism. In the most immediate sense, Wikipedia’s core characteristics can serve as a pointer toward how we climb out of the epistemic crisis we are experiencing. Most importantly, it will not be by emphasizing market actors or reasserting a cultural authority whose luster has long dimmed.
For journalism, for example, the nonmarket attribute means that we will need a much greater investment in models that depart from advertising as a major source of income, and that are not for profit. Whether through a properly-insulated model of public funding, as in the model of the BBC; an endowed philanthropy trust, as in the case of the Guardian or the Poynter Institute’s acquisition of Politifact; or a nonprofit organization funded by user donations, like public radio in the United States
 
and the Wikimedia Foundation, we need the heart of professional journalism to resolve the perennial tension between the editorial side and the business side by shifting emphasis away from market- based independence for media toward society-based independence from government. Moreover, the transparent and “show me” participatory model of governance that characterizes Wikipedia (for all its faults) suggests a transition from “trust us, we’re professionals” to “show your work and engage with reasons” as the central practice of responsible journalism. Internal peer review is important, as is transparency to the outside world to the very limit of what can be done without compromising confidential sources. We need parallel recommitment to public funding for science, and a reversal of longstanding trends to reduce the fiscal burden on public research by shifting investment to business R&D.
Note that I focus in these areas of journalism and science not on “citizen journalism” or “citizen science”, which are the direct correlates of Wikipedia, but on nonmarket journalism and science. Each of these plays an important role in the contemporary media and innovation ecosystems. But the past twenty years have also taught us their limitations. As long as we continue to live in a society in which the basic necessities of life—food, shelter, health, education, etc. need to be purchased in markets, then we will need some method of providing at least some people a way of engaging in these pursuits as a vocation, not merely an avocation. While Wikipedia itself has provided an inspiring example of a knowledge good produced purely from volunteer work, when we look at other efforts to replicate it, particularly in areas that are time sensitive like news, we have seen that some mix of professional and amateur, rather than pure amateur efforts, have worked best. In the networked public sphere, it is that mix of approaches and levels of engagement that has been the most productive. So the lesson is to diversify from purely citizen journalism or science as the extension of Wikipedia the idea, and to understand that a critical part of what Wikipedia stands for is the importance of nonmarket production as a counterweight to those producers driven and directed by commercial incentives.
More generally, as we design policy interventions or think about how to arrange our affairs as a society, we need to learn from the failures of CBPP to capture a broader range of core utilities than seemed possible when Wikipedia was five, or even ten. We need to develop ways of integrating the nonmarket and participatory, or nonhierarchical aspects of Wikipedia into systems that also seek to harness the more traditional models of organization, in particular the state. The literature on “democratic experimentalism” in governance has for twenty years sought to develop regulatory mechanisms that engage participants in the regulated practices, including most importantly participants who are not market actors, academic experts, engaged members of civil society, to develop a more responsive and adaptive regulatory system. How to do so is far from a settled problem. But the critical turning point is to recognize that solutions to the present crisis of confidence in government and governance will not be to double down on the strategy of privatizing provisioning of public goods or to rely on market mechanisms to solve the failures of public institutions. Instead, the
 
solution space we must explore is that which Wikipedia and CBPP laid out—participatory, social, and not dependent on or subservient to the discipline of markets.

* * *

Warts and all, Wikipedia and commons-based peer production more generally continue to offer existence proof that there can be another way. People can work together, build a shared identity in a community of practice, and make things they need without resorting to enforced market exchange. Working out how to generalize this form to society at large, cognizant of its imperfections and limitations; how to enable people to satisfy their basic material needs as they work together, without being forced into working in a competitive labor market that defines their choices and tradeoffs; how to integrate commons-based practices into a system that still includes and relies on both state and market processes; how to use its lessons to improve each of these other systems; and how to protect the commons from the relentless encroachment by market and state actors we have seen in the past decade, working out how all these combine to make a genuine alternative to neoliberalism is the great challenge of the next 20 years.

A Virtual Ever-After
Utopia, Race, and Gender in Black Mirror’s “San Junipero”
 


Lauded as “2016’s most life-affirming piece of television,”[1] “San Junipero,” the fourth episode of Black Mirror’s third season, has captured the hearts of the LGBTQIA community and beyond. The show radically upends the ‘Bury Your Gays’ trope, offering an eternal paradise to a ‘mixed-race,’ queer romance. To the dismay of Black Mirror fans, Charlie Brooker, writer and creator of the dystopian anthology series, finally offered viewers a happy ending. The episode not only constitutes an exception to Black Mirror’s unapologetic message of doom and gloom but made queer happiness the condition for that exception.
This chapter explores how the episode is at a remove from Black Mirror’s usual portrayal of virtual reality (VR) as Virilian ‘deception’ or ‘substitution,’ to promise and deliver two women an unimaginable life after death. I argue that the VR space of San Junipero does this by ‘queering’ death, so that San Junipero becomes a heterochronic Foucauldian cemetery, a non-place between reality and virtuality. Through a study of José Esteban Muñoz’s conception of queer futurity, and De Witt Douglas Kilgore’s exploration of the utopian potential of astrofuturism, I demonstrate how San Junipero’s heterochronic cemetery supersedes heteronormative ‘death’ to allow Yorkie and Kelly’s romance a second chance at success in virtual heaven.

OVERVIEW OF THEORY
In his 1994 The Vision Machine, Paul Virilio explores the “blindness” experienced by users of “real-time video computer graphics,” arguing that “the production of sightless vision is itself merely the reproduction of an intense blindness that will become the latest and last form of industrialization: the industrialization of the non-gaze.”[2] This is Virilio’s grim prediction for the virtual image, a computer- mediated mode of experiencing the world, which results in human vision becoming less adept at interpreting and responding to the surrounding environment. Users subsequently experience a “steady decline in retention rates,” “the rapid collapse of mnemonic consolidation” (memory formation), and a reduction of their capacity to organize and exercise their “cognitive functions.”[3] The virtual image processed by human eyes is thus one of “deception” in its “substitution” of reality, making the user a “slave to the faith in the technical sightline.”[4] For Virilio, this is a phenomenon that owes its pervasiveness in part to wider issues of twenty-first-century surveillance and warfare, which employ the tools of VR to practice a modern form of dominance and destruction, a war of “images and sounds.”[5]
Where Virilio rejects as “disturbing”[6] the potentialities of VR as a meeting place between users, also criticizing the proponents of cybernetic sexuality as “the servants of a new type of sexual control,”[7] feminist theorist Elizabeth Grosz focuses somewhat asymmetrically on “how conceptions of virtuality, simulation, computer reproduction and rendering transform our understanding of the real, matter, space, the body, and the world.”[8] Grosz interrogates how our understanding of the ‘real’ can be transformed by a deeper understanding of the codependence of what she terms the “interior” and the “exterior” worlds, claiming that the architecture of the interior—the consciousness—can always also be thought of in terms of the exteriority of corporeal surfaces: the “complexities, specificities, and materialities of bodies.”[9] In other words, “the virtual is immanent in the real”[10] : the virtual exists in and through the ‘real’ just as the ‘real’ is often the referent of the virtual.
 
I approach this analysis of how San Junipero is also able to transform lives and hearts in the ‘real’ world by way of this conceptualization of virtuality as a bi-directional movement between VR and ‘real’ spaces. San Junipero is a heterotopic space, which has been defined by Michel Foucault as a “mixed, intermediate experience” between reality and virtuality, which can produce a positive return effect on the ‘real.’[11] Like the utopia, the heterotopia possesses “the curious property of being in relation with all the other sites, but in such a way as to suspect, neutralize, or invent the set of relations that they happen to designate, mirror, or reflect,”[12] thus presupposing “a system of opening and closing that isolates them and makes them penetrable at the same time.”[13] Some heterotopias, such as the graveyard, hospital, and nursing home, operate as spaces of “temporal discontinuities” [decoupages du temps]:
c’est-à-dire qu’elles ouvrent sur ce qu’on pourrait appeler, par pure symétrie, des hétérochronies; l’hétérotopie se met à fonctionner à plein lorsque les hommes se trouvent dans une sorte de rupture avec leurs temps traditionnel.[14]
[that is, they open onto what might be called, for the sake of symmetry, heterochronias. The heterotopia begins to function fully when people find themselves in a kind of absolute break with their traditional time.][15]
The heterochronic space of “temporal discontinuity” exists at a remove from productive time.[16] In this sense, these spaces can also be productively seen as queer: they deviate from the heteronormative linearity of “traditional time” to allow for new realities to emerge.
In his elaboration of Judith Halberstam’s important work on time and normativity, In a Queer Time and Place,[17] José Esteban Muñoz posits that queer time is “a thing that is not the linearity that many of us have been calling straight time,”[18] and must “resist the stultifying temporality and time that is not ours, that is saturated with violence both visceral and emotional.”[19] Nominally non- reproductive, queers, like the elderly and the hospitalized of Foucault’s heterotopic/chronic nursing homes, hospitals, and cemeteries, inhabit spaces that deviate from reproductive futurity. Muñoz’s utopian conceptualization of a future which does not extend out of the ideological impasses of the present, allows for the emergence of a “not yet” wherein queer desires and aspirations can take shape. But Muñoz’s Blochian “not yet” is also drawn from the “no-longer-conscious,”[20] the traces of the past whose unrealized potential can be released into a queer future. This utopian hermeneutic, wherein the past generates other presents and futures, is Muñoz’s way of historicizing without turning to “normative historical analysis.”[21]
By tracing the tradition of African American speculative thinking, astro- and afrofuturism also provide useful models of historicized future-thinking, which welcome the formation of other, reinvigorated futures based in revisions of the past. [22] De Witt Douglas Kilgore, in particular, explores heterotopic conceptions of the future that form heterogenous spaces of resistance to the colonization of space by racist and capitalist ideologies. Crucially, these are spaces which, while transcending normative spatio-temporalities, are also embedded in the situated “identities and agendas” of people who exist “somewhere and   at   sometime”:   “Although   utopia   may   never   shake   the charge of being nowhere at any time, heterotopia is distinguished by always being somewhere and at some time. It is achievable through available means, and is inhabited by identities and agendas that mirror the complexity of our ordinary world.”[23] Where science fiction utopias often assume that racist societies will disappear in the future with the eradication of either diversity or difference, Kilgore’s conception of the astrofuturist heterotopia brings to the fore the historical and cultural specificity of its people and its spaces. Indeed, Kilgore follows Foucault to define heterotopia as “a space that is always material and bounded, partial and transitional, hybrid and momentarily, if ever, homogenous.”[24] As I explore below, for the heterotopia to impart benefits onto its occupiers, it must maintain a transitional position between ‘real’ and virtual space.

“SAN JUNIPERO”
 
“San Junipero” is the story of Kelly and Yorkie, played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Mackenzie Davis, who meet and fall in love in the VR Californian beachside party town of San Junipero. Kelly and Yorkie’s romance is an unlikely one. As we discover near the end of the episode, they are not entirely the young, attractive, and sprightly party-town residents that they first appear to be. In the ‘real’ world, Kelly is a widowed octogenarian dying of terminal cancer who has never acted on her “crushes” for other women, while Yorkie is a hospitalized quadriplegic virgin, who, after an unwelcome coming out to her homophobic parents forty years earlier, drove off the road in a near-fatal car crash.
Thanks to “immersive nostalgia therapy,” Kelly and Yorkie’s consciousnesses, for a limit of five hours a week, are granted a second chance at life when re-embodied as healthy twenty-somethings in the virtual town of San Junipero. Once there, visitors can move from decade to decade as they please, passing from the 1980s to the 1990s and back again.[25] As they slip through San Junipero’s multi- layered virtual pasts, sites of utopian potentiality where the queer desires of their youth resurface, Kelly and Yorkie also transcend the unstoppable tick of mortality that is all too present in the hospital ward and the retirement home. At the end of the episode, they decide to “go permanent,” and, once they are granted permission to undergo the state-controlled euthanasia and “pass over” to San Junipero forever, Kelly and Yorkie achieve eternal romance in the cloud. This result prompted an explosion of commentary from Black Mirror digital fandom, with headlines including “Queer Women Are Losing Their Shit Over the Perfection of ‘San Junipero’”[26] shared and reshared across social media.

“SAN JUNIPERO,” VR, AND HETEROTOPIA
I begin by exploring how “San Junipero” subverts Black Mirror’s usual representation of the problematics of VR, in particular its potential to deceive its users by blurring the boundaries of reality and virtuality, as theorized by Paul Virilio.[27] My thesis is that the virtual paradise of San Junipero is able to improve the quality of Kelly and Yorkie’s reality on Earth by behaving as a Foucauldian heterotopia. I draw on José Esteban Muñoz’s study of queer futurity and De Witt Douglas Kilgore’s work on utopia and astrofuturism to demonstrate how San Junipero’s heterochronic cemetery allows Yorkie and Kelly’s queer romance to overcome the obstacles posed by race and gender in the domain of the ‘real.’
For many LGBTQIA fans, Kelly and Yorkie’s happy ending was lauded for its refusal of the Bury Your Gays trope, which in sending queer characters to the graveyard with appalling regularity makes them more expendable to films and television shows than their heterosexual counterparts. Yet the episode could have easily done the opposite: regular Black Mirror viewers, accustomed to Charlie Brooker’s worst-case-scenario endings of near-future tech horror stories, might have expected this gay romance to go the same way as any other romance on the show: bottom up. Any one of an infinite selection of the drawbacks of VR could have, instead, been the episode’s lesson of the day. Kelly’s sparse ocean view nursing home, Yorkie’s silent state-of-the-art hospital, and the modern TCKR systems’ buildings—vacant of human life—which house the archipelago of data centers that maintain San Junipero’s virtuality: these units position the viewer to wonder, as is the case in several other episodes of Black Mirror, if technology only serves the rich and whether it has foreclosed the possibility of all human contact.
Black Mirror is littered with unfortunate victims of technology. They evoke what its viewers, glued to our screens as we watch consecutive episodes, have perhaps have already become, products of what Paul Virilio has termed the “industrialization of the non-gaze.”[28] This is explored to frightening effect in the episodes “The Entire History or You” (S1E3) and “Men Against Fire” (S3E5): in the former, implants allow characters to watch their memories on playback, while their eyes, sightless to the present, are glazed over like the waking dead; in the latter, technologically mediated vision is used as a military-political tool that allows soldiers to perceive an invisible enemy.
The passive optics of the video lens, so easily transformed into a commercially viable product and sold en masse to generations of tech-hungry consumers, will, for Virilio, forever push human consciousness out of reality and into another dimension. Indeed, Black Mirror fans have taken to
 
online forums to discuss the socio-economic points of enquiry left unpacked by “San Junipero”: would individuals trust a corporate giant with their ever-after? What kind of guarantee could TCKR systems offer that they would keep a person’s soul for eternity? Could this ever be profitable for any enterprise, or has their society changed so completely that payment and profit are no longer a priority?
Perhaps the most pressing of the concerns put forward and then swiftly batted aside by the episode are voiced by Greg, Yorkie’s hospital nurse, in a conversation with Kelly:
Kelly: “They ration [VR time] out. Huh! They don’t trust us with more.”
Greg: “They say you go crazy if you have too much. Don’t leave your seat, you disassociate body from mind . . .”
Kelly: “Like that doesn’t happen in every senior home already.” [Chuckles]
We hear in Greg the Virilian fear of VR as “deception,” a simulacrum of reality that makes the user a “slave to the faith in the technical sightline,” as they “no longer believe their eyes.”[29] To choose the realm of fantasy at the expense of reality, would be, as Virilio puts it, to transfer consciousness “from the actual to the virtual,” resulting in “a general loss of a sense of reality that permeates all aspects of normal life.”[30] Not only does Kelly shrug off this grim prediction, but she also suggests a different kind of deception experienced by the elderly in senior homes: the deception of mortality, of unfulfilled desires, and for Yorkie, the codes of social morality that foreclose on the possibility of exercising freedom of sexuality.
Paralyzed, permanently hospitalized, and robbed of a chance at love, Yorkie is already dependent on technology to support her vital organs and allow her to communicate. Unable to choose to die without permission from her family, who refuse to give it, she must weave her own web of deception, marrying Greg (though ultimately Kelly steps in to be her wife) in a sham bedside service that makes Kelly “family” and thus eligible to sign off on her transfer into the eternal VR ever-after of San Junipero. Where Virilio rejects cybernetic sexuality as the “waning of reality,”[31] the domination of humanity by technology, “San Junipero” explores how humanity’s repressive social systems have already limited the expression of human life, refusing Yorkie and Kelly a chance at queer love, a promise that technology paradoxically fulfills.
The beach town of San Junipero thus behaves not as a Virilian “substitution” for reality,[32] but instead like a Foucauldian heterotopia—a “mixed, intermediate experience” between reality and virtuality that produces a positive return effect on the ‘real.’[33] As such, it is fruitful to explore the Foucauldian interpretation of Black Mirror’s duo of cemeteries—one a traditional burial ground on Earth, the other a futuristic virtual server farm—which the viewer encounters at the end of the episode. They offer Yorkie and Kelly the possibility to transcend the limits of heteronormative immortality and pursue a non-reproductive and queer immortality.
The first burial ground is a familiar vision of a North American cemetery in a neatly kept field lined with identical graves. In one of the closing scenes, Kelly’s body, encased in her coffin, is being gently lowered by an invisible force into the rectangular pit. This is the kind of silver screen cemetery that queer viewers are all too familiar with: a premature death is often the inevitable fate of gay, bisexual, and trans characters in films and on television. But the brevity of the scene, coupled with the fact that there are no visible mourners, makes the segment as upbeat as is possible for a burial, directing the viewer’s attention toward the imminence of Kelly’s future. The camera then swiftly pans to the TCKR systems buildings, where a robotic arm is inserting a data drive of Kelly’s permanently transferred consciousness into a data socket on a wall of hundreds of other encrypted ‘souls.’ In this dark, synthetically illuminated data-cemetery, saturated with state-of-the-art technology which activates the consciousnesses of those who have had their bodily death on Earth, Kelly’s eternal life is about to begin. If this is the engine behind the virtual “heaven” of San Junipero, then perhaps, as the episode’s theme tune, Belinda Carlisle’s 1987 hit song proclaims, heaven really is a place on Earth.
This duo of graveyards can be interpreted as the ultimate realization of a Cartesian mind-body dialectic, the achievement of the masculinist fantasy of control over the self, the separation of extended, imperfect body from the infinite, disembodied and unextended the mind. But for the queer happy ever after to come into effect, the utopian consciousness offered by San Junipero must be an
 
embodied one, existing in relation to the lived experience of sexed and racialized bodies in the ‘real’ world. Without its interactions with the Earthly imperfections of mortality, homophobia, and racial prejudice, San Junipero cannot afford consolation to its visitors by making up for the failures of the homeland, Earth, nor begin to actually intervene and improve the “reality” from which they, however temporarily, escape.
Foucault describes the relational utopia of the heterotopia as possessing “the curious property of being in relation with all the other sites, but in such a way as to suspect, neutralize, or invent the set of relations that they happen to designate, mirror, or reflect.”[34] San Junipero, powered by TCKR systems’ paradoxical graveyard-of-life, is both deeply imbricated in the Earthly dimension, and yet at a variance with it, existing in another space with a different temporal structure. As a Foucauldian heterotopia, which always presupposes “a system of opening and closing that isolates them and makes them penetrable at the same time,”[35] San Junipero is both accessible from the outside and cut off from reality, both by government regulations—which limit the time spent by the elderly in the virtual resort—and by the body which anchors the user in the domain of the ‘real.’ Indeed, the virtual city must be, as the Foucauldian heterotopia requires, both geographically unmappable and located in relation to those bodies and social spaces that it occupies in the “real.”
Kelly and Yorkie’s interactions move between the virtual and the real: San Junipero and the hospital. It is because of this dual emplacement afforded by VR, which demands that the user be in a ‘real’ place and also an imagined one, that San Junipero calls the limitations of ordinary reality into question, actively affording Kelly and Yorkie the possibility to “suspend, neutralize, or reverse” the set of relations that connect them to the ‘real’ world. Using VR to interrupt the consciousness of their bodies in real-time allows for transformation and resistance in San Junipero that then translates back to reality as real-world interventions.
There are three instances where these meaningful realities are made visible; firstly, committed to see the woman she loves in the flesh, Kelly travels across America to visit Yorkie in hospital. Thus, the “contact at a distance” offered by VR, as propounded by Grosz, also produces proximity in ‘real’ space.[36] When Kelly sees her youthful, lithe San Junipero lover as a bed-ridden quadriplegic, she begins to love the ‘real’ Yorkie, a love that is subsequently, and somewhat problematically, proved by Kelly’s wish both to step in for Greg and marry Yorkie at the hospital, and to make the ‘real,’ and difficult, decision to permanently unite her consciousnesses with Yorkie’s in the ever-after.
Secondly, Kelly and Yorkie’s time in San Junipero manifests itself in the present as the experience of real-world satisfaction at being able to embody the past differently. Their time spent in the nursing home and the hospital is thus enriched by the opportunity offered by San Junipero to do all that they would have liked to do on Earth but never had the chance. These other pasts, where everything was “up for grabs,” as Kelly reminds Yorkie, is the basis for their ever-after in San Junipero. Thirdly, utopia invades reality across the dimensions of time, space, and television, as viewers around the world experience hope and joy from the humorous upending of the Bury Your Gays trope, in the quite literal resurrection of two buried gays.
Reading San Junipero as a Foucualdian heterotopia—that which suspends and subverts linear time—illuminates the way in which Yorkie and Kelly’s use of its VR landscape opens up the possibility of pursuing queer futurity in the present, described by Muñoz as “an opening or horizon,”[37] a counter to the prescriptive end gestured at by the hospital, cemetery and nursing home. Queer futurity therefore becomes the condition for the appearance of a future beyond San Junipero’s technologically mediated death. We return again to the cemetery, but this time, as a Foucauldian heterochronia—the “timezone” within which the heterotopia exists. Heterochronias are spaces of “temporal discontinuities” [decoupages du temps], which like the hospital and the nursing home, two of the episode’s other heterochronias, are characterized by an absolute break from productive time.[38]
In his elaboration of Jack Halberstam’s important analysis of time and normativity, In a Queer Time and Place, José Esteban Muñoz posits that queer time is “a thing that is not the linearity that many of us have been calling straight time”[39] and must “resist the stultifying temporality and time that is not ours, that is saturated with violence both visceral and emotional.”[40] Nominally non- reproductive queers, like the elderly and the hospitalized, inhabit spaces which deviate from
 
reproductive futurity. Queer time, as experienced by Yorkie and Kelly, not only rejects the finality of the cemetery, but its association with the systematic annihilation of gay people during the AIDS crisis, of homosexual modes of life, as well as the premature death of gay characters in film and television. The graveyard, as that non-space where for too long queer potentiality has been discarded, deemed inexpressible, and covered over with soil, becomes now only a memory of a time when queers were not welcome. By living beyond the graveyard, Yorkie and Kelly escape what Muñoz terms “the stultifying temporality”[41] of heteronormative time, and achieve an ever-after devoid of the tropes of heterosexual futures: a white wedding and babies. Kelly and Yorkie’s queer romance was not the coincidental winner of Black Mirror’s happy ending, but the condition for the appearance of that hopeful future.
Following Muñoz, who borrows from Bloch and Jameson, San Junipero can be read as operating according to a queer utopian hermeneutic: that which on the one hand is no-longer-conscious, and on the other is not-yet. Kelly and Yorkie’s unfulfilled potential is subsequently projected into a possible future where it can be accessed. This temporal maneuver constitutes an important and widely heralded refusal of racial divisions and homophobia in the present. There are two ways in which the episode performs this queer utopian hermeneutic to interrupt the linear heteronormative temporality of past, present, and future. Firstly, as has been discussed above, the queer utopian potentialities unexplored in Kelly and Yorkie’s pasts are projected onto San Junipero—their desires and ambitions— and secondly, as I now explore in more detail, because time travel within San Junipero offers the imminent exploration of endless, unexplored utopian potentialities. Temporal fluidity within the heterotopic town, where inhabitants move from the 1980s to the 2000s at will, is not exercised at the expense of geographical, historical, and cultural situatedness. Through a brief study of De Witt Douglas Kilgore’s work on utopia and astrofuturism, I demonstrate how San Junipero, behaving as a Foucualdian heterotopia, offers localized and situated alternate pasts in which racial and gender identities can be renegotiated through available means in Yorkie and Kelly’s present.
De Witt Douglas Kilgore, in his study of astrofuturism, which is a form of “speculation about the progress and final aims of technological and political power” that is “deeply implicated in debates on race, class and gender,”[42] explores the movement’s utopian and heterotopian possibilities. Kilgore notes that heterotopic conceptions of the future, in particular, constitute hybrid and multiple spaces of resistance that are “distinguished by always being somewhere at sometime,” while utopia is often critiqued for “being nowhere at any time.”[43] For Kilgore, the distinction between utopian and heterotopian conceptions of the future is particularly critical when confronted with the desire to reimagine race in the future, while also not forgetting the past. Where science fiction utopias often assume that racist societies will disappear in the future with the eradication of either diversity or difference, Kilgore’s conception of the astrofuturist heterotopia brings to the fore the historical and cultural specificity of its people and its spaces.
Kilgore follows Foucault to define heterotopia as “a space that is always material and bounded, partial and transitional, hybrid and momentarily, if ever, homogenous.”[44] San Junipero, consistent with Kilgore’s definition of the heterotopia, is not merely fixed in one utopian “no place” but is always in-between, moving from decade to decade at the will of its users, neither fully fantasy nor fully detached from the real. In this sense, San Junipero is always imbued by time and memory. While the characters do not explicitly refer to the difficulties which might have arisen from a ‘mixed-race’ lesbian romance in America in the 1980s, their conversations, which refer equally to both their pasts on Earth (in one typical conversation, Kelly asks Yorkie, “when did you know that you liked women?” 23:00), and their possible futures on San Junipero, is a reminder of the reality they might have faced had their romance blossomed in the USA in 1980s.
While ‘interracial’ marriage in America would have been constitutional following the June 1967 Loving vs. Virginia ruling, anti-miscegenation laws persisted in several states, with Alabama being the final state to align its laws with the Supreme Court ruling, only permitting ‘interracial’ marriage in 2000. Supporters of ‘interracial’ marriage in the United States were also in the minority during the 1980s: Gallup’s Minority Rights and Relations poll, a survey of 4,373 Americans including 1,010 “non- Hispanic blacks,” conducted between 1958 and 2013, revealed that ‘interracial’ marriage only received
 
majority approval from ‘Whites’ in 1997, having been approved by ‘Non-Hispanic black’ respondents since the beginning of the poll in 1956.[45]A similar poll undertaken by Gallup asking whether respondents believed that gay and lesbian relations between consenting adults should or should not be legal found that between 1982 and 1988 disapproval ratings actually increased from 39 to 57 percent. As of 1989, this figure fell to 36 percent, with a surge in respondents answering “no opinion;” however, gay and lesbian relations only received majority nationwide approval in 2001.[46]
San Junipero’s heterotopic time travel allows its inhabitants to act on their desire to experience variations on the past, to relive these decades shrugged free from social or legal difficulties and impossibilities, while retaining their attachment to place, culture, and history. When Tucker’s disco transforms 1980s funk music to the synth-pop of the 1990s, the past is projected into yet another future so that an era is born again. In the process, the original decade is substituted by one of many possible heterotopic variations, embedded in a different time and space. The freedom afforded to these new reincarnations of the nostalgia decades demonstrates that ‘White’ heteropatriarchy’s systems of oppression function through their inhabiting of a particular space, time, and geography. By way of spatio-temporal maneuver, Kelly and Yorkie’s youths are repeatedly replaced by other, alternate worlds neither fully detached from, nor fully consistent with, their original. San Junipero’s anti-racist heterotopia thus enables a proliferation, rather than an eradication of, racial and gender subjectivities, creating the conditions for the expression, enactment, and validation of the innumerable ways to desire and love.

CONCLUSION
As Foucault ends “Of Other Spaces” with the metaphor of the ship, for him the ultimate heterotopia, so “San Junipero” ends with a 1993 Mazda Mx5 NA, Brooker’s heterotypic vehicle of choice (to the eco-conscious reader—San Junipero’s cars are presumably as fumeless, weightless, and placeless as the town itself). Inside the convertible, Kelly and Yorkie drive toward the utopian horizon, bathed in technicolor sunset, blasting Belinda Carlisle’s 1987 classic, “Heaven Is a Place on Earth.” The Mazda runs with the unstoppable energy of the utopian imagination, which functions outside of, and yet is deeply imbricated with, the heteronormative machinations of time and space. San Junipero’s promise of a better future, comprised of a remixed past, overwrites the past to actualize an improved reality, offering hope—the petrol of utopia—to those in front of, as well as behind, the television screen. “San Junipero”—not a single place but the possibility of endless and multiple culturally and historically situated spaces—follows the viewer as we leave our screens, offering hope and refuge to those Black Mirror fans who have come to suffer, live, and love alongside Kelly and Yorkie.
